Pollutant Trends and Impact Visualization: A Data Science Perspective on Indian Air Quality
This project delves into the exploration and analysis of air quality data in India, with a focus on pollution trends and the impact of various pollutants on public health and the environment. The goal is to preprocess, visualize, and derive actionable insights from the dataset related to pollutants across various cities in India. Through this project, we aim to showcase the current state of air quality and its variations over time and location.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
The project involves the following major steps:

Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values and converting data types.

Cleaning and standardizing city names, pollutant levels, and other features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Investigating the dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships between pollutants and cities.

Analyzing pollution across different cities, pollutants, and timeframes.

Data Visualization:

Creating meaningful visualizations using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to represent trends and patterns in the data.

Visualizing pollutant distributions, city-wise pollution, pollutant trends, and air quality classifications.

Statistical Analysis:

Performing statistical tests (like t-tests) to compare pollution levels across different pollutants.

Correlation analysis to uncover relationships between different pollutants.

Prediction & Classification:

Building linear regression models to predict pollutant levels based on other variables.

Classifying air quality into categories like 'Good', 'Moderate', and 'Poor' based on pollutant levels.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations
Key visualizations included in the project are:

Top 10 Polluted Cities: A bar plot displaying the cities with the highest average pollutant levels.

Pollutant Distribution: Violin and strip plots to show the distribution of various pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, etc.

Heatmap: A heatmap visualizing the relationship between cities and pollutants, showing average pollutant levels.

Air Quality Classification: A count plot of air quality categories (Good, Moderate, Poor) based on the pollutant levels in the dataset.

Pollutant Level Predictions: A linear regression plot comparing actual vs predicted pollutant levels.
